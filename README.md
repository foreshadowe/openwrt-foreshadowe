# openwrt-foreshadowe
A GitHub project for generating openwrt firmware of Raspberry Pi 4b

Writing & Testing  

# Discription
I tried to compile and generate my own openwrt (based on lede source) on my local machine, but I don't have time to compile it every day to get the newest update. So I'm trying using GitHub actions to compile it automatically though I know nothing about GitHub actions. So you can see the code is totally a piece of shit.
But at least it should run functionally.
Only support Raspberry Pi 4b, because I only have 4b...

# Includings
passwall  
passwall2  
ssr plus  
clash  
openclash  
samba  

P.S. I'm testing this project and it hasn't finished.
